What to draw? 
When to flip? 
Where are loops? 
What kind of loops? 
What variables? structured how? 

# PseudoCode

Option A:  for loop

Create a window (gray, approximately square)
Create a fixation dot or parameters for a fixation dot
set a variable blob_to_disappear  = 1
specify n_cycles 
specify disappearance time (how long each dot is absent)
Describe 12, or n, locations, sizes, and colors of dots (aka blobs) around a circle

for cycle in n_cycles:
	for dot to disappear in (12 dots)
		for dot index in 12 dots :
			if not dot to disappear
				draw dot (dot index)
			else 
				don't  draw dot
		 draw fixation
		 flip screen
		 wait disappearance time
	
Option B: while loop

specify n_seconds 
Create (n) dots (aka blobs) (size, color, location)
Save as a list or cell array
specify disappearance time (how long each dot is absent)
get start time
Describe 12, or n, locations, sizes, and colors of blobs around a circle
while (get clock time) < (start time + n_seconds)
	for this_dot in n dots :
		if not dot to disappear == this_dot
			draw dot 
		else 
			don't  draw dot
	 increment dot to disappear (+1)
	 draw fixation 
	 flip screen
	 wait disappearance time
	 if blob to disappear is > 12
		 Reset dot to disappear to 0 or 1 (python or matlab)
		 (Use mod function in matlab or % operator )
